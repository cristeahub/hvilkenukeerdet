# Hvilken uke er det?

This small program tells you what week number it is straight in your terminal!

## Why?

If you are like me, and live in a country where week number of everything is used as
an alternative to a date, you will need to know what week number the current week is.
This simle tool lets you figure that out!

## How?

Simply run `uke` in your terminal!

## Installation

Run `make install` and you will conveniently get your executable put in
`/usr/local/bin`. After this you will be able to run `uke` in your terminal.

## Hvilk..what?

The name of this repo is the norwegian phrase "Hvilken uke er det?" put together to one word.
Translated to english it means "What week is it?" which is the general expression norwegians
use to ask for the week number. It is also the web page of the site being used to fetch the
week number.

The word `uke` is the norwegian word for week. This was chosen as it's most likely not being
used by some other program.

## Thanks

Thanks to [Hvilken uke er det?](http://www.hvilkenukeerdet.no) for telling me what week it
is for years now. This is the web page being scraped to find out what week it actuallty is.

# Hvilken uke er det?

This small program tells you what week number it is straight in your terminal!

## Why?

If you are like me, and live in a country where week number of everything is used as
an alternative to a date, you will need to know what week number the current week is.
This simle tool lets you figure that out!

## How?

Simply run `uke` in your terminal!

## Installation

Run `make install` and you will conveniently get your executable put in
`/usr/local/bin`. After this you will be able to run `uke` in your terminal.
